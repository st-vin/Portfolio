# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Portfolio

Thanks for visiting. This is my personal portfolio â€” a straightforward space to highlight my work, background, and interests in computer science.

## What is this?

A clean, functional site built entirely with HTML and CSS. Itâ€™s meant to demonstrate both the technical and design side of my skills â€” no external libraries, just native code pushed to do more than expected.

## Whatâ€™s Included

* **Home** â€“ Brief overview and introduction.
* **About** â€“ A bit about my background, approach, and goals.
* **Skills** â€“ Languages, tools, and frameworks I use (Python, JavaScript, Rust, Django, React, etc.).
* **Education** â€“ Academic history and relevant certifications.
* **Interests** â€“ Broader areas Iâ€™m drawn to â€” including Web Development, AI, and developer communities.
* **Projects** â€“ A few selected works:

  * **Grade Analyzer** â€“ A tool for analyzing student performance.
  * **File Canvas** â€“ A smarter way to interact with your files visually.
* **Contact** â€“ Ways to reach me for work, collaboration, or conversation.

## How to Use It

Open `index.html` in any browser. All styling and assets are self-contained. The site is responsive across screen sizes and doesnâ€™t require any additional setup.

## Why I Built It

* To develop and present a focused, code-first portfolio
* To show what can be done with just HTML and CSS
* To have a personal, self-hosted space for sharing work and connecting with others
